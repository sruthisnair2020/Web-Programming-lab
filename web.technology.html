<p>Web Technlogy is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web technology can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web technology commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

Among Web professionals, "Web Technlogy " usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

<br>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web technology may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the server

Definition - What does Web Programming mean?
Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.<br><br><br>
<b>Techopedia explains <i>Web programming</i></b><br><br>
Web programming can be briefly categorized into client and server coding. The client side needs programming related to accessing data from users and providing information. It also needs to ensure there are enough plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures.

<ol type="1">
<li>To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. It is an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications</li>
<li>HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks</li>
</ol>
<p>The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. There are certain tools/platforms that aid in both client- and server-side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus.<br><br><br>

<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines<br><br>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability. This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace<br> <br>

<u><h1 align="center" style="font-size:50px;"> <a Name="Frame Works">FRAME WORKS</a></h1></u>
<center><img src="image5.jpg" height="30%" width="30%"></img></center>

<p>A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. ... Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development<br>
Frameworks have become an essential part of web development, as the standards of web applications are always rising, so does the complexity of the technology needed. It’s completely unreasonable to reinvent the wheel for such sophisticated techniques -assuming that you can reinvent all that. That’s why using frameworks endorsed by thousands of developers around the world is a very sensible approach for building rich and interactive web applications. A web app has a backend (server-side) and a frontend (client-side), so we discuss both best Backend frameworks as well as frontend frameworks. Here goes the list of best web development frameworks in 2020:<br>

<h2>Best Backend Frameworks</h2><br>
<p style="font-size:30px;">From RESTful APIs to complete MVC frameworks, here are some of the most robust backend frameworks in 2020 that you might be interested to learn<br>

<ol type="1">
<li style="font-size:30px;">Express</li>
<p>Thanks to the skyrocketing popularity of Node.js, Express is quickly becoming one of the most trending frameworks nowadays. It is popular amongst Accenture, IBM and Uber, and many other companies, and it’s also compatible with other frameworks such as Kraken, Sails, and Loopback.

Express prides itself as a minimal, fast, and unopinionated framework. It provides some core framework functionalities without obscuring the features of Node and leverages the robust performance of the asynchronous Node.js. It’s also quite flexible and supports full applications as well as REST API, as well. Perhaps the biggest drawback of Express is the fact that there’s no defined way of doing things, at least for beginners<br>
<li style="font-size:30px;">Rails</li>
<p>Rails is a Model-View-Controller framework that uses Ruby, and it’s a popular framework that is loved by many developers. Airbnb, GitHub, Hulu, and Shopify are primary users of Rails. Rails is considered a beginner-friendly framework, and the fact pros and cons are debated, helps beginners get started with web development quite quickly. There are many useful gems for rails, which are library-like dependencies that extend the functionalities of your application and helps you develop even faster and more efficiently. The Rails community is quite reliable and friendly, and there are many tutorials, screencasts, and resources that can help you become a rails expert in no time.

The main disadvantage of rails lies in the fact that they take quite some effort to deploy and run in a production environment, and the learning curve of rails becomes steep once you dive deeper into the framework to unravel the magic behind it<br>
<li style="font-size:30px;">Laravel</li>
<p>Laravel is a Model-View-Controller framework that uses PHP, which is one of the most popular languages of the web. It’s relatively young compared to other frameworks on this list.

Laravel comes with API support out of the box, and it also possesses a decent amount of packages that could extend its reach. Laracasts is a screencasts tutorials website with over a thousand videos on PHP, Laravel, and frontend technologies in the Laravel ecosystem that could be considered to be a beginner’s heaven. In terms of performance, however, Laravel doesn’t compare to Django or Express, which might be a drawback for massive projects</ol><br><br>
<u><h1 align="center" style="font-size:50px;"> <a Name="Web 2.O">WEB 2.O</a></h1></u>
<center><img src="image7.jpg" height="30%" width="30%"></img></center>
<p>The term "Web 2.0" was coined by Darcy DiNucci, an information architecture consultant, in her January 1999 article "Fragmented Future"

The Web we know now, which loads into a browser window in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will appear on your computer screen,  on your TV set your car dashboard  your cell phone hand-held game machines  maybe even your microwave oven.

Writing when Palm Inc. introduced its first web-capable personal digital assistant (supporting Web access with WAP), DiNucci saw the Web "fragmenting" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by HTTP would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her "2.0" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.

The term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002. Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, "the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform" In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that "customers are building your business for you" They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called "Web 1.0". They associated this term with the business models of Netscape and the Encyclopædia Britannica Online. For example,

Netscape framed "the web as platform" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the "horseless carriage" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a "webtop" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.[23]

In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with Google, a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its "PageRank" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and Wikipedia – while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the open source software adage "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any "bugs" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.

The popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by 2006 TIME magazine Person of The Year. That is, TIME selected the masses of users who were participating in content creation on social networks, blogs, wikis, and media sharing sites.<br>
<h2>SOCIAL WEB</h2>
<p >A third important part of Web 2.0 is the social web. The social Web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences. Web 2.0 applications tend to interact much more with the end user. As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant by:<br>

<u><h1 align="center" style="font-size:50px;"> <a Name="Data Formats">DATA FORMATS</a></h1></u>
<center><img src="image6.jpg" height="30%" width="30%"></img></center>
<p><i>How data formats are used in HTTP</i>:Now that we've explored some available data formats, we need to know how to use them in HTTP. To do so, we will say hello again to one of the fundamentals of HTTP: headers. In Chapter 2, we learned that headers are a list of information about a request or response. There is a header for saying what format the data is in: Content-Type.

When the client sends the Content-Type header in a request, it is telling the server that the data in the body of the request is formatted a particular way. If the client wants to send the server JSON data, it will set the Content-Type to "application/json." Upon receiving the request and seeing that Content-Type, the server will first check if it understands that format, and, if so, it will know how to read the data. Likewise, when the server sends the client a response, it will also set the Content-Type to tell the client how to read the body of the response.

Sometimes, the client can only speak one data format. If the server sends back anything other than that format, the client will fail and throw an error. Fortunately, a second HTTP header comes to the rescue. The client can set the Accept header to tell the server what data formats it is able to accept. If the client can only speak JSON, it can set the Accept header to "application/json." The server will then send back its response in JSON. If the server doesn't support the format the client requests, it can send back an error to the client to let it know the request is not going to work.

With these two headers, Content-Type and Accept, the client and server can work with the data formats they understand and need to work properly.<br>


<u><h1 align="center" style="font-size:50px;"> <a Name="Protocols">PROTOCOLS</a></h1></u>
<center><img src="image4.jpg" height="30%" width="30%"></img></center>
<p >Internet Protocol is connectionless and unreliable protocol. It ensures no guarantee of successfully transmission of data.

In order to make it reliable, it must be paired with reliable protocol such as TCP at the transport layer.<br>
<h2> File Transfer Protocol(FTP)</h2>FTP is used to copy files from one host to another. FTP offers the mechanism for the same in following manner:
<ul type="square">

<li>FTP creates two processes such as Control Process and Data Transfer Process at both ends i.e. at client as well as at server</li>

<li>FTP establishes two different connections: one is for data transfer and other is for control information</li>

<li>Control connection is made between control processes while Data Connection is made between</li>

<li>FTP uses port 21 for the control connection and Port 20 for the data connection</li><br>

<h2> Trivial File Transfer Protocol(TFTP)</h2>:Trivial File Transfer Protocol is also used to transfer the files but it transfers the files without authentication. Unlike FTP, TFTP does not separate control and data information. Since there is no authentication exists, TFTP lacks in security features therefore it is not recommended to use TFTP.

<p><b>Key points</b>

<li>TFTP makes use of UDP for data transport. Each TFTP message is carried in separate UDP datagram</li>

<li>The first two bytes of a TFTP message specify the type of message</li>

<li>The TFTP session is initiated when a TFTP client sends a request to upload or download a file</li>

<li>The request is sent from an ephemeral UDP port to the UDP port 69 of an TFTP server</li></ul><br>

<p>To conclude, Project Data Grid works like a component which can access all the databases and picks up different functions. It overcomes the many limitations incorporated in the attendance.

<ul type="square">
<li>Easy implementation environment</li>


<li>Generate report flexibly</li></ul>


<ul type="rectangle">Scope for future development:-

 

<p>The project has a very vast scope in future. The project can be implemented on intranet in future. Project can be updated in near future as and when requirement for the same arises, as it is very flexible in terms of expansion. With the proposed software of database Space Manager ready and fully functional the client is now able to manage and hence run the entire work in a much better, accurate and error free manner. The following are the future scope for the project.


<li>Discontinue of particular student eliminate potential attendance</li>


<li>Bar code Reader based attendance system</li>


<li> Individual Attendance system with photo using Student login</li></ul><br><br>

<p>Development of ARCADE is on-going, and there is still much to do. The author currently has a list of some 150 enhancements planned for the future, varying from trivial to very complex. Some of these, in no particular order, are listed below.

There is currently no special software for editing the configuration file describing the structure of the laboratories! This is stored in a text file and carefully altered with a standard text editor.

Perhaps the most complex intended extension is a provision for running unit-based laboratory courses. The idea here is that there would be a number of equally weighted units, or `milestones' making up the total work for one module. In order to fit in with a deadline structure, the number of units would be a whole multiple of the number of laboratory sessions. Each deadline would require a student to hand-in at least some number of units, and at most some greater number of units. For example, a module might have 10 sessions, with 20 units. The minimum hand-in for each session would be one unit, the maximum would be two. The problem with this scheme is the management of which units correspond to which deadlines: this would be different for each student depending on his or her previous pattern of work!

It is certainly intended to tie-up ARCADE more closely with plagiarism detection software (currently it can be made to complain that a student has failed to proffer a piece of work for such detection as part of his or her feedback). Future plans include managing the process of negotiation with `accused' students, and even automatically emailing them about suspicious work before a human has looked at it!

Similarly, it would be very easy to integrate the system with automatic assessment software, and this is planned for the near future.

Much consideration has been given to the effect on the student body when the late penalty system exposes that the work is too hard, but nothing is done to reduce it. This is manifested when large numbers of students miss extended deadlines. In the discussion on deadlines and late flags above, we said that an original axiom of ARCADE is that, in general, laziness should be the only reason for a student getting a late flag. When this is not true, the effect on student morale can be very negative, even more so if they cannot skip out some deadlines in order to meet later ones. Unless one deals with this very carefully, the students tend to give up realising they have nothing to gain by trying hard, once they have enough marks to pass. Of course, the real solution is to make the work more realistic. However, when this does not seem to be possible, an alternative kind of late penalty may help: that of `graduated lateness'. This means that the amount a piece of work is flagged late grows the later it gets, rather than all of it being late immediately. The penalty would still not be expressed by deducting marks on individual exercises, like in many schemes, as one still does not want a student to fail overall merely through being late.

Another intended enhancement is to give the students more `ownership' of their data, by providing a mechanism to allow them look at it whenever they choose, rather than to wait until the laboratory manager emails it to them, or to have to ask for it. To this end, a recent development has been a client and server to allow a wider access to ARCADE, but the work is not yet finished. As this will be provided to non-expert users, a nice GUI is required. This client will also provide students with a structured way to respond to irregularities which they believe are erroneous. Currently, they either email the laboratory manager and typically give insufficient information, or they speak to the laboratory staff who may fail to solicit the exact information. Instead, the client program will ask them the right questions as appropriate to the irregularity concerned. A similar client-server is planned for staff use, so they can directly access information on their modules, or their tutees, etc..

As was stated earlier, the current strategy of sending irregularities once per week only to those students for which they are different from the week before, seems to be the best of the approaches tried. However, there is a feeling that even this can be improved on, and a future version will split the feedback into sections, one each for new irregularities since last sending, ones that were there last time but have changed, ones that are unchanged since last time, and those which have gone. This is based on an impression that many students do not keep a record of the feedback they are getting, so can find it hard to see in what way their irregularities have improved or got worse.

Related to the above is an idea to allow a student to confirm that he or she is aware of a particular irregularity, and thus for it no longer to be included in the automatic feedback. This is motivated by the odd student in the past who has been irritated by being told of a piece of work missed that he has known about and cannot do anything about now. However, the need for this may be somewhat undermined by the above plan to split the feedback into sections.

Much of the interaction between the laboratory manager and individual students is done through email, and ARCADE already provides several email sending tools. A future version will provide dedicated email management and storage facilities to make the process of receiving email less time consuming for the manager.<br>
